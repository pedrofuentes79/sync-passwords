Take into account that a very specific setup needs to be in place for this script to work.

First, you need to use rclone and **MOUNT** the drive you want (you should also only mount specific files you want to sync, not everything on your drive, since bad things could happen...)

You should enter your specific configurations in `config.json` and make sure everything is okay regarding the rclone mounting.
